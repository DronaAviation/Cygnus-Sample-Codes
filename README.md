# Pluto Drone Projects Using Cygnus IDE

Welcome to the repository for various projects developed for Pluto using the Cygnus IDE. This repository includes a collection of C++ files, each corresponding to a unique project aimed at exploring and enhancing the capabilities of Pluto drones.

## About Pluto

Pluto (Drone), developed by Drona Aviation, is designed to offer an exceptional user experience both in flight and tinkering. These drones serve as an excellent prototyping tool for innovators and tinkerers, allowing them to implement and test their ideas with ease. The Pluto platform includes hardware and software components, providing a seamless experience for users.

## About Cygnus IDE

Cygnus IDE is a development environment specifically tailored for programming Pluto . It simplifies the process of writing, testing, and deploying code onto Pluto drones. Cygnus IDE supports various features and APIs that make it easier for developers to create custom functionalities and control behaviors of their drones.

## List of Projects

### 1. DEBUG APIs (Pluto 1.2 & Pluto X)
Learn to use debug APIs like LED and print to detect the movement of the drone in the vertical direction and display velocity values on the Pluto Monitor.

### 2. CHUCK TO ARM (Pluto 1.2 & Pluto X)
Arm your drone by tossing it in the air instead of using traditional methods. This project teaches the concept of free fall and the working of an accelerometer.

### 3. FLY ACRO (Pluto 1.2 & Pluto X)
Explore different flight modes available in drones by understanding the basics of gyro sensors and improving your flying skills.

### 4. PHONE CLONE (Pluto 1.2 & Pluto X)
Clone your phone's movements to control the drone, offering a unique and intuitive way to pilot your drone.

### 5. OPEN SESAME (Pluto 1.2 & Pluto X)
Develop a project that allows your drone to interact with the environment by detecting and responding to specific signals.

### 6. TEMPERATURE REACTIVE DRONE (Pluto 1.2 & Pluto X)
Create a drone that reacts to temperature changes, demonstrating the integration of environmental sensors.

### 7. TURTLE TURN (Pluto X)
Learn how to program your drone to execute precise turns, mimicking the movements of a turtle.

### 8. X RANGER (Pluto X)
Enhance your drone's range and control by implementing advanced communication protocols.

### 9. AIR PONG (Pluto X)
Develop a fun and interactive game where the drone plays pong in the air, showcasing real-time response and control.

### 10. WALLS ARE LAVA (Pluto X)
Program your drone to avoid walls and obstacles, simulating a challenging environment.

### 11. HYBRID DRONE (Pluto X)
Combine various control mechanisms to create a versatile and adaptive drone.

### 12. AUTO-STABILIZATION (Pluto X)
Implement auto-stabilization features to ensure smooth and stable flight under various conditions.
